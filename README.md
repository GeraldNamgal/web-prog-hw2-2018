# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I added a requirement to 'requirements.txt' called 'pytz' that enables my app to
have timestamps.

I created classes for my app that are in 'classes.py'. My 'application.py' file
contains all my server-side code. 'index.js' in the 'static' folder has all the
client-side code. 'index.html' is in the templates folder. It has all my html
code for my app. My 'styles.css' file is in the 'css' folder located in the
'static' folder. It has all my styling code for my app.

The buttons on my app are disabled by default until there is text in their input
fields.

My personal touch is that users are allowed to delete messages. They can do this
only on current sessions. So if they close the browser and return, they will no
longer be able to delete the messages they've already submitted. There's a
button on the app that users can press labelled Delete a Message for this.

I used Google Chrome for testing and developing.
